ACS defines a set of control points within a PCI Express topology to determine
whether a TLP is to be routed normally, blocked, or redirected. ACS is
applicable to RCs, Switches, and Multi-Function Devices. <sup>120</sup> For ACS
requirements, single-Function devices that are SR-IOV capable must be handled
as if they were Multi-Function Devices, since they essentially behave as
Multi-Function Devices after their Virtual Functions (VFs) are enabled.

Implementation of ACS in RCiEPs is permitted but not required. It is explicitly
permitted that, within a single Root Complex, some RCiEPs implement ACS and
some do not. It is strongly recommended that Root Complex implementations
ensure that all accesses originating from RCiEPs (PFs and VFs) without ACS
capability are first subjected to processing by the Translation Agent (TA) in
the Root Complex before further decoding and processing. The details of such
Root Complex handling are outside the scope of this specification.

ACS provides the following types of access control:

* ACS Source Validation
* ACS Translation Blocking
* ACS P2P Request Redirect
* ACS P2P Completion Redirect
* ACS Upstream Forwarding
* ACS P2P Egress Control
* ACS Direct Translated P2P
* ACS I/O Request Blocking
* ACS DSP Memory Target Access
* ACS USP Memory Target Access
* ACS Unclaimed Request Redirect

The specific requirements for each of these are discussed in the following
section.

ACS hardware functionality is disabled by default, and is enabled only by
ACS-aware software. With the exception of ACS Source Validation, ACS access
controls are not applicable to Multicast TLPs (see § Section 6.14 ), and have
no effect on them.

> ACS 硬件功能默认禁用，只能通过支持 ACS 的软件启用。除 ACS Source Validation，
> ACS access control 不适用于 Multicast TLP（参见第 6.14 节），并且对其没有影响。

### 6.12.1 ACS Component Capability Requirements

ACS functionality is reported and managed via ACS Extended Capability
structures. PCI Express components are permitted to implement ACS Extended
Capability structures in some, none, or all of their applicable Functions. The
extent of what is implemented is communicated through capability bits in each
ACS Extended Capability structure. A given Function with an ACS Extended
Capability structure may be required or forbidden to implement certain
capabilities, depending upon the specific type of the Function and whether it
is part of a Multi-Function Device.

> ```
> extent: 程度,幅度,范围
> ```
> ACS 功能通过 ACS 扩展功能结构进行报告和管理。PCI Express 组件可以在部分、全部或
> 不部分适用功能中实现 ACS 扩展功能结构。实现的范围通过每个 ACS 扩展功能结构中的
> 功能位进行传达。具有 ACS 扩展功能结构的给定功能可能需要或禁止实现某些功能，
> 具体取决于功能的具体类型以及它是否是多功能设备的一部分。

ACS is never applicable to a PCI Express to PCI Bridge Function or a Root
Complex Event Collector Function, and such Functions must never implement an
ACS Extended Capability structure.

> 不适用 PCIE to PCI bridge Function / Root Complex Event Collector Function.

#### 6.12.1.1 ACS Downstream Ports

This section applies to Root Ports and Switch Downstream Ports that implement
an ACS Extended Capability structure. This section applies to Downstream Port
Functions both for single-Function devices and Multi-Function Devices.

> 本节适用于实现 ACS 扩展功能结构的Root Port 和Swith Downstream port。本节适
> 用于单功能设备和多功能设备的下游端口功能。

* ACS Source Validation: must be implemented.

  When enabled, the Downstream Port tests the Bus Number from the Requester ID
  of each Upstream Request received by the Port to determine if it is
  associated with the Secondary side of the virtual bridge associated with the
  Downstream Port, by either or both of:
  > 下游端口会检查每个上游请求的请求者 ID 中的总线编号，以确定它是否与与下游端口
  > 相关的虚拟桥的 Secondary side 相关联，可以通过以下一种或两种方式进行判断：

  + Determining that the Requester ID falls within the Bus Number “aperture” of
    the Port - the inclusive range specified by the Secondary Bus Number
    register and the Subordinate Bus Number register.
    > ```
    > aperture: 光圈
    > falls within: 落在
    > ```
    > 确定请求者 ID 是否落在端口的总线编号“孔径”内 - 由Subordinate总线编号寄存器
    > 和 Secondary 总线编号寄存器指定的包含范围。

  + If FPB is implemented and enabled, determining that the Requester ID is
    associated with the bridge’s Secondary Side by the application of the FPB
    Routing ID mechanism.
    > 如果实现并启用了 FPB，则通过应用 FPB 路由 ID 机制确定请求者 ID 与桥的
    > 次级侧相关联。

    If the Bus Number from the Requester ID of the Request is not within this
    aperture, this is a reported error (ACS Violation) associated with the
    Receiving Port (see § Section 6.12.5 .)

    > 如果请求中请求者 ID 的总线号不在此范围内，则这是与接收端口相关的已报告错误
    > （ACS 违规），详见第 6.12.5 节。

    Completions are never affected by ACS Source Validation.

> ```
> IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
> UPSTREAM MESSAGES AND ACS SOURCE VALIDATION
> ```
> 
> Functions are permitted to transmit Upstream Messages before they have been
> assigned a Bus Number. Such messages will have a Requester ID with a Bus Number
> of 00h. If the Downstream Port has ACS Source Validation enabled, these
> Messages (see § Table F-1, § Section 2.2.8.2 , and § Section 6.22.1 ) will
> likely be detected as an ACS Violation error.
>
> 在未分配总线号之前，Function 允许发送Upstream消息。此类消息将具有一个总线号为 00h
> 的请求者 ID。如果下行端口启用了 ACS 源验证，则这些消息（参见表 F-1、第 2.2.8.2 节和第
> 6.22.1 节）可能会被检测为 ACS 违规错误。

* ACS Translation Blocking: must be implemented.

  When enabled, the Downstream Port checks the Address Type (AT) field of each
  Upstream Memory Request received by the Port. If the AT field is not the
  default value, this is a reported error (ACS Violation) associated with the
  Receiving Port (see § Section 6.12.5 ). This error must take precedence over
  ACS Upstream Forwarding and any applicable ACS P2P control mechanisms.
  Completions are never affected by ACS Translation Blocking.

  > 启用时，下行端口会检查其接收到的每个上行内存请求的地址类型（AT）字段。
  > 如果 AT 字段不是默认值，则这是与接收端口相关的已报告错误（ACS 违规，参见第
  > 6.12.5 节）。此错误必须优先于 ACS 上行转发和任何适用的 ACS P2P 控制机制。
  > Completions 不会受到 ACS 翻译阻止的影响。

* ACS P2P Request Redirect: must be implemented by Root Ports that support
  peer-to-peer traffic with other Root Ports; <sup>121</sup> must be implemented by Switch
  Downstream Ports.

  > ACS P2P 请求重定向：支持与其他根端口进行点对点通信的根端口必须实现该功能；
  > 必须由 Swith 下游端口实现。

  ACS P2P Request Redirect is subject to interaction with the ACS P2P Egress
  Control and ACS Direct Translated P2P mechanisms (if implemented). Refer to §
  Section 6.12.3 for more information.

  > ACS P2P 请求重定向受 ACS P2P 出口控制和 ACS 直接翻译 P2P 机制（如果已实现）的影响。
  > 有关更多信息，请参阅第 6.12.3 节。

  When ACS P2P Request Redirect is enabled in a Switch Downstream Port,
  peer-to-peer Requests must be redirected Upstream towards the RC.

  > 当在交换机下游端口启用 ACS P2P 请求重定向时，点对点请求必须向上游重
  > 定向到根复合体（RC）。

  When ACS P2P Request Redirect is enabled in a Root Port, peer-to-peer
  Requests must be sent to Redirected Request Validation logic within the RC
  that determines whether the Request is “reflected” back Downstream towards
  its original target, or blocked as an ACS Violation error. The algorithms and
  specific controls for making this determination are not architected by this
  specification. 

  > 当在根端口启用 ACS P2P 请求重定向时，点对点请求必须发送到根复合体（RC）中的
  > Redirected Request logic，该逻辑确定请求是“反射”回下游以返回其原始目标，还是作为 
  > ACS 违规错误被阻止。本规范并未设计用于作出此决定的算法和具体控制。

  Downstream Ports never redirect Requests that are traveling Downstream.

  > ```
  > travel: 旅行
  > ```
  > 下游端口绝不重定向向下游发送的请求。

  Completions are never affected by ACS P2P Request Redirect.

* ACS P2P Completion Redirect: must be implemented by Root Ports that implement
  ACS P2P Request Redirect; must be implemented by Switch Downstream Ports.

  The intent of ACS P2P Completion Redirect is to avoid ordering rule
  violations between Completions and Requests when Requests are redirected.
  Refer to § Section 6.12.6 for more information.

  ACS P2P Completion Redirect does not interact with ACS controls that govern
  Requests.

  When ACS P2P Completion Redirect is enabled in a Switch Downstream Port,
  peer-to-peer Completions 122 that do not have the Relaxed Ordering Attribute
  bit set (1b) must be redirected Upstream towards the RC. Otherwise,
  peer-to-peer Completions must be routed normally.

  When ACS P2P Completion Redirect is enabled in a Root Port, peer-to-peer
  Completions that do not have the Relaxed Ordering bit set must be handled
  such that they do not pass Requests that are sent to Redirected Request
  Validation logic within the RC. Such Completions must eventually be sent
  Downstream towards their original peer-to-peer targets, without incurring
  additional ACS access control checks.

  Downstream Ports never redirect Completions that are traveling Downstream.

  Requests are never affected by ACS P2P Completion Redirect.

* ACS Upstream Forwarding: must be implemented by Root Ports if the RC supports
  Redirected Request Validation; must be implemented by Switch Downstream
  Ports.

  When ACS Upstream Forwarding is enabled in a Switch Downstream Port, and its
  Ingress Port receives an Upstream Request or Completion TLP targeting the
  Port’s own Egress Port, the Port must instead forward the TLP Upstream
  towards the RC.

  When ACS Upstream Forwarding is enabled in a Root Port, and its Ingress Port
  receives an Upstream Request or Completion TLP that targets the Port’s own
  Egress Port, the Port must handle the TLP as follows. For a Request, the Root
  Port must handle it the same as a Request that the Port “redirects” with the
  ACS P2P Request Redirect mechanism. For a Completion, the Root Port must
  handle it the same as a Completion that the Port “redirects” with the ACS P2P
  Completion Redirect mechanism.

  When ACS Upstream Forwarding is not enabled on a Downstream Port, and its
  Ingress Port receives an Upstream Request or Completion TLP that targets the
  Port’s own Egress Port, the handling of the TLP is undefined.

* ACS P2P Egress Control: implementation is optional.

  ACS P2P Egress Control is subject to interaction with the ACS P2P Request
  Redirect and ACS Direct Translated P2P mechanisms (if implemented). Refer to
  § Section 6.12.3 for more information.

  A Switch that supports ACS P2P Egress Control can be selectively configured
  to block peer-to-peer Requests between its Downstream Ports. Software can
  configure the Switch to allow none or only a subset of its Downstream Ports
  to send peer-to-peer Requests to other Downstream Ports. This is configured
  on a per Downstream Port basis.

  An RC that supports ACS P2P Egress Control can be selectively configured to
  block peer-to-peer Requests between its Root Ports. Software can configure
  the RC to allow none or only a subset of the Hierarchy Domains to send
  peer-to-peer Requests to other Hierarchy Domains. This is configured on a per
  Root Port basis.

  With ACS P2P Egress Control in Downstream Ports, controls in the Ingress Port
  (“sending” Port) determine if the peer-to-peer Request is blocked, and if so,
  the Ingress Port handles the ACS Violation error per § Section 6.12.5 .

  Completions are never affected by ACS P2P Egress Control.

* ACS Direct Translated P2P: must be implemented by Root Ports that support
  Address Translation Services (ATS) and also support peer-to-peer traffic with
  other Root Ports; 123 must be implemented by Switch Downstream Ports.

  When ACS Direct Translated P2P is enabled in a Downstream Port, peer-to-peer
  Memory Requests whose Address Type (AT) field indicates a Translated address
  must be routed normally (“directly”) to the peer Egress Port, regardless of
  ACS P2P Request Redirect and ACS P2P Egress Control settings. All other
  peer-to-peer Requests must still be subject to ACS P2P Request Redirect and
  ACS P2P Egress Control settings.

  Completions are never affected by ACS Direct Translated P2P.

* ACS I/O Request Blocking: must be implemented by Root Ports and Switch
  Downstream Ports that support ACS Enhanced Capability.

  When enabled, the Port must handle an Upstream I/O Request received by the
  Port’s Ingress as an ACS Violation.

* ACS DSP Memory Target Access: must be implemented by Root Ports and Switch
  Downstream Ports that support ACS Enhanced Capability and that have
  applicable Memory BAR Space to protect.

  ACS DSP Memory Target Access determines how an Upstream Request received by
  the Downstream Port’s Ingress and targeting any Memory BAR Space 124
  associated with an applicable Downstream Port is handled. The Request can be
  blocked, redirected, or allowed to proceed directly to its target. In a
  Switch, all Downstream Ports are applicable, including the one on which the
  Request was received. In a Root Complex, the set of applicable Root Ports is
  implementation specific, but always includes the one on which the Request was
  received.

* ACS USP Memory Target Access: must be implemented by Switch Downstream Ports
  that support ACS Enhanced Capability and that have applicable Memory BAR
  Space in the Switch Upstream Port to protect; is not applicable to Root
  Ports.

  ACS USP Memory Target Access determines how an Upstream Request received by
  the Switch Downstream Port’s Ingress and targeting any Memory BAR Space 125
  associated with the Switch’s Upstream Port is handled. The Request can be
  blocked, redirected, or allowed to proceed directly to its target.

  If any Functions other than the Switch Upstream Port are associated with the
  Upstream Port, this field has no effect on accesses to their Memory BAR Space
  126 . Such access is controlled by the ACS Extended Capability (if present)
  in the Switch Upstream Port.

* ACS Unclaimed Request Redirect: must be implemented by Switch Downstream
  Ports that support ACS Enhanced Capability; is not applicable to Root Ports.

  When enabled, incoming Requests received by the Switch Downstream Port’s
  Ingress and targeting Memory Space within the memory window of a Switch
  Upstream Port that is not within a memory window or Memory BAR Target of any
  Downstream Port within the Switch are redirected Upstream out of the Switch.

  When not enabled, such Requests are handled by the Switch Downstream Port as
  an Unsupported Request (UR).

#### 6.12.1.2 ACS Functions in SR-IOV Capable and Multi-Function Devices

This section applies to Multi-Function Device ACS Functions, with the exception
of Downstream Port Functions, which are covered in the preceding section. For
ACS requirements, single-Function devices that are SR-IOV capable must be
handled as if they were Multi-Function Devices.

* ACS Source Validation: must not be implemented.
* ACS Translation Blocking: must not be implemented.
* ACS P2P Request Redirect: must be implemented by Functions that support
  peer-to-peer traffic with other Functions. This includes SR-IOV Virtual
  Functions (VFs).

  ACS P2P Request Redirect is subject to interaction with the ACS P2P Egress
  Control and ACS Direct Translated P2P mechanisms (if implemented). Refer to §
  Section 6.12.3 for more information.

  When ACS P2P Request Redirect is enabled in a Multi-Function Device that is
  not an RCiEP, peer-to-peer Requests (between Functions of the device) must be
  redirected Upstream towards the RC.

  It is permitted but not required to implement ACS P2P Request Redirect in an
  RCiEP. When ACS P2P Request Redirect is enabled in an RCiEP, peer-to-peer
  Requests, defined as all Requests that do not target system memory, must be
  sent to implementation specific logic within the Root Complex that determines
  whether the Request is directed towards its original target, or blocked as an
  ACS Violation error. The algorithms and specific controls for making this
  determination are not architected by this specification.

  Completions are never affected by ACS P2P Request Redirect.

  ACS P2P Completion Redirect: must be implemented by Functions that implement
  ACS P2P Request Redirect. The intent of ACS P2P Completion Redirect is to
  avoid ordering rule violations between Completions and Requests when Requests
  are redirected. Refer to § Section 6.12.6 for more information.

  ACS P2P Completion Redirect does not interact with ACS controls that govern
  Requests.

  When ACS P2P Completion Redirect is enabled in a Multi-Function Device that
  is not an RCiEP, peer-to-peer Completions that do not have the Relaxed
  Ordering bit set must be redirected Upstream towards the RC. Otherwise,
  peer-to-peer Completions must be routed normally.

  Requests are never affected by ACS P2P Completion Redirect.

* ACS Upstream Forwarding: must not be implemented.

* ACS P2P Egress Control: implementation is optional; is based on Function
  Numbers or Function Group Numbers; controls peer-to-peer Requests between the
  different Functions within the multi-Function or SR-IOV capable device.

  ACS P2P Egress Control is subject to interaction with the ACS P2P Request
  Redirect and ACS Direct Translated P2P mechanisms (if implemented). Refer to
  § Section 6.12.3 for more information.

  Each Function within a Multi-Function Device that supports ACS P2P Egress
  Control can be selectively enabled to block peer-to-peer communication with
  other Functions or Function Groups 127 within the device. This is configured
  on a per Function basis.

  With ACS P2P Egress Control in multi-Function or SR-IOV capable devices,
  controls in the "sending" Function determine if the Request is blocked, and
  if so, the "sending" Function handles the ACS Violation error per § Section
  6.12.5 .

  When ACS Function Groups are enabled in an ARI Device (ACS Function Groups
  Enable is Set), ACS P2P Egress Controls are enforced on a per Function Group
  basis instead of a per Function basis. See § Section 6.13 .

  Completions are never affected by ACS P2P Egress Control.

* ACS Direct Translated P2P: must be implemented if the Multi-Function Device
  Function supports Address Translation Services (ATS) and also peer-to-peer
  traffic with other Functions.

  When ACS Direct Translated P2P is enabled in a Multi-Function Device,
  peer-to-peer Memory Requests whose Address Type (AT) field indicates a
  Translated address must be routed normally (“directly”) to the peer Function,
  regardless of ACS P2P Request Redirect and ACS P2P Egress Control settings.
  All other peer-to-peer Requests must still be subject to ACS P2P Request
  Redirect and ACS P2P Egress Control settings.

  Completions are never affected by ACS Direct Translated P2P.

#### 6.12.1.3 Functions in Single-Function Devices

This section applies to single-Function device Functions, with the exception of
Downstream Port Functions and SR-IOV capable Functions, which are covered in a
preceding section. For ACS requirements, single-Function devices that are
SR-IOV capable must be handled as if they were Multi-Function Devices.

No ACS capabilities are applicable, and the Function must not implement an ACS
Extended Capability structure.
