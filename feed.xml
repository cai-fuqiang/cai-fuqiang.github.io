In many implementations, it has been common practice to assume that the physical address space seen by the CPU and by an I/O Function is equivalent. While in others, this is not the case. The address programmed into an I/O F...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>CHAPTER 2 Coherence Basics</title><link href="/posts/coherence_basic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CHAPTER 2 Coherence Basics" /><published>2025-03-29T14:50:00+08:00</published> <updated>2025-03-29T14:50:00+08:00</updated> <id>/posts/coherence_basic/</id> <content src="/posts/coherence_basic/" /> <author> <name>fuqiang</name> </author> <category term="cache" /> <summary>In this chapter, we introduce enough about cache coherence to understand how consistency models interact with caches. We start in Section 2.1 by presenting the system model that we consider throughout this primer. To simplify the exposition in this chapter and the follow- ing chapters, we select the simplest possible system model that is sufficient for illustrating the important issues; we defe...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Consistency and Coherence</title><link href="/posts/consistency_and_coherence/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Consistency and Coherence" /><published>2025-03-29T10:42:00+08:00</published> <updated>2025-03-29T10:42:00+08:00</updated> <id>/posts/consistency_and_coherence/</id> <content src="/posts/consistency_and_coherence/" /> <author> <name>fuqiang</name> </author> <category term="cache" /> <summary>1.2 COHERENCE (A.K.A., CACHE COHERENCE) Unless care is taken, a coherence problem can arise if multiple actors (e.g., multiple cores) have access to multiple copies of a datum (e.g., in multiple caches) and at least one access is a write. Consider an example that is similar to the memory consistency example.

These models define correctness so that programmers know what to expect and implementors know what to provide. We first motivate the need to define memory behavior (Section 3.1), say what a memory con- sistency model should do (Section 3.2...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>svm</title><link href="/posts/svm-overflow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="svm" /><published>2025-03-03T13:30:00+08:00</published> <updated>2025-03-03T13:30:00+08:00</updated> <id>/posts/svm-overflow/</id> <content src="/posts/svm-overflow/" /> <author> <name>fuqiang</name> </author> <category term="amd_spec" /> <category term="svm" /> <summary>文章主要来自AMD sdm `15 Secure Virtual Machine overflow SVM 提供了由硬件扩展，旨在实现高效, 经济的虚拟机系统。其功能主要分为 virtualization support 和 security support, 概述如下: virtualization support memory guest/host tagged TLB External (DMA) access protection for memory Nested paging support interrupt virtualization Intercepting physic...</summary> </entry> </feed>
